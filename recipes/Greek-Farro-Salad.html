    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great alternative to a cold pasta salad as farro doesn't get soggy and holds up to the dressing very well.</p>
    <p>Farro is an ancient Mediterranean grain, so I wanted to merge it with a Greek-style salad that's perfect for summertime. This is great served with grilled lamb or chicken. Add black olives or fresh herbs to your liking! </p>
